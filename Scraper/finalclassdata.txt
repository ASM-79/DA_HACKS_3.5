Course Title: Introduction to 3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing
Description: This course provides a comprehensive overview of additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, spanning from fundamentals to applications and industry trends. Students will understand how to design, fabricate (produce), and measure 3D printed parts using a range of printing technologies and materials. They will develop knowledge of the seven (7) ISO/ASTM-defined 3D printing processes and evaluate each process's capabilities, material characteristics, parameters, and design considerations. Emphasis will be placed on current additive manufacturing industry applications, design principles, and production standards. In-class sessions will feature demonstrations and projects using the latest industry-grade 3D printers and post-processing equipment.

Description: This course is an introduction to data analysis making use of graphical and numerical techniques to study patterns and departures from patterns. The student studies randomness with an emphasis on understanding variation, collects information in the face of uncertainty, checks distributional assumptions, tests hypotheses, uses probability as a tool for anticipating what the distribution of data may look like under a set of assumptions, and uses appropriate statistical models to draw conclusions from data. The course introduces the student to applications in engineering, business, economics, medicine, education, social sciences, psychology, the sciences, and those pertaining to issues of contemporary interest. The use of technology (computers or graphing calculators) will be required in certain applications. Where appropriate, the contributions to the development of statistics by men and women from diverse cultures will be introduced.
